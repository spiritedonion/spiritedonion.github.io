# Active Directory and PAM360

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for the Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems. It provides a variety of features, such as user and resource management and Certificate Services, which are essential for a secure IT environment.

PAM360, on the other hand, is a comprehensive privileged access management solution that helps businesses consolidate and manage their privileged accounts. It provides a single console from which you can manage privileged access, monitor sessions, and record all activities related to privileged access to ensure security and compliance.

Together, AD and PAM360 can provide a secure and efficient environment for managing user access and privileges. PAM360's integration with Active Directory can help streamline the process of managing privileged accounts, making it easier to ensure that the right people have the right access at the right time.
