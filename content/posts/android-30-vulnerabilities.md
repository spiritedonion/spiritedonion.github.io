Mobile applications handle sensitive user data, making them a frequent target for attackers. Android, due to its open ecosystem, presents a wide attack surface if applications are not properly secured.

This article walks through 30 common Android vulnerabilities, along with practical methods to identify and remediate them using both static and dynamic analysis.

## 1. Task Hijacking (StrandHogg)

Task hijacking occurs when a malicious application exploits `taskAffinity` to insert itself into another app's task stack, allowing UI spoofing and data interception.

**How to identify**
- Review `AndroidManifest.xml` for custom `taskAffinity` values
- Check for risky launch modes such as `singleTask` or `singleInstance`
- Use dynamic tools like Frida or Xposed to monitor task behavior
- Manually switch between apps and observe unexpected UI transitions

**How to fix**
- Set `android:taskAffinity=""` unless required
- Prefer `standard` or `singleTop` launch modes
- Avoid unnecessary task manipulation

---

## 2. Tapjacking

Tapjacking tricks users into interacting with hidden UI elements through overlays.

**How to identify**
- Check for `android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="false"`
- Test overlays using a secondary app
- Observe whether touches pass through obscured screens

**How to fix**
- Enable `filterTouchesWhenObscured`
- Apply `setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true)` to sensitive views

## Final Thoughts

Android security is not a one-time effort. It requires continuous testing, secure coding practices, and awareness of evolving threats.

Combining static analysis, dynamic testing, and proper defensive design significantly reduces the attack surface. Aligning with the **OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide** is a good baseline for building and assessing secure applications.
